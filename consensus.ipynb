    "# Thoughts\n",
    "Options are:\n",
    "1. Satellites send their own positional and trajectory info, along with IDs of any satellites they witness\n",
    "    - No external measurements needed, just basic witnessing\n",
    "    - Satellite A reports: ' I saw satellite B and here is my positional data'. Satellite B reports 'I saw satellite A and here is my positional data'. Can verify that these are correct within a certain error tolerance. Is it mathematically possible they saw each other?\n",
    "2. Satellites send the position and and velocity info of a satellite they witness\n",
    "    - Requires accurate measurement of another satellite's position and velocity from another satellite. Not sure every satellite can do this. \n",
    "    - Stronger witnessing, but larger data set to send. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Need to consider doppler shift, TLE data, how can satellites actually witness each other? Through ISLs and broadcasting?\n",
    "- Could it be verified against existing ground data to begin with? Then moved away with ground as a back up for redundancy?\n",
    "- What calculations would need to be performed? \n",
