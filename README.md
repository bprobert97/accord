# Introduction to ACCORD
Autonomous Cooperative Consensus Orbit Determination (ACCORD) is a decentralised framework for satellite operations in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). It addresses the limitations of centralised coordination, such as single points of failure and trust bottlenecks, by leveraging a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).

In ACCORD, satellites use on-board sensors to observe one another and collaboratively determine their orbital positions. These observations are submitted to the distributed ledger, where consensus is achieved through Proof of Inter-Satellite Evaluation (PoISE) - a novel, reputation-based, Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism. Unlike traditional blockchain systems, PoISE does not rely on financial incentives or intermediaries. Instead, it validates orbit data by evaluating mutual observations and assessing the trustworthiness of both the data and the observing satellites.

This decentralised approach enhances data integrity, trust, and resilience across heterogeneous constellations. As more satellites join the network, ACCORD scales naturally, enabling secure and autonomous satellite operations—even in zero-trust environmen

# Current Status

The project is currently at TRL 0. The PoISE consensus mechanism is in the early phases of development by [Beth Probert](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/beth-probert), a PhD student at the University of Strathclyde's Applied Space Technology Laboratory. Once development of PoISE is completed, the rest of the ACCORD framework shall be developed around this consensus mechanism. By incorporating smart contracts in future development, the system will enable autonomous decision-making, allowing satellites to self-govern, coordinate tasks, and reroute services in real time.
