    "# Thoughts\n",
    "Options are:\n",
    "1. Satellites send their own positional and trajectory info, along with IDs of any satellites they witness\n",
    "    - No external measurements needed, just basic witnessing\n",
    "    - Satellite A reports: ' I saw satellite B and here is my positional data'. Satellite B reports 'I saw satellite A and here is my positional data'. Can verify that these are correct within a certain error tolerance. Is it mathematically possible they saw each other?\n",
    "2. Satellites send the position and and velocity info of a satellite they witness\n",
    "    - Requires accurate measurement of another satellite's position and velocity from another satellite. Not sure every satellite can do this. \n",
    "    - Stronger witnessing, but larger data set to send. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Need to consider doppler shift, TLE data, how can satellites actually witness each other? Through ISLs and broadcasting?\n",
    "- Could it be verified against existing ground data to begin with? Then moved away with ground as a back up for redundancy?\n",
    "- What calculations would need to be performed? \n",
    "- Incentivised to provide honest information with reputation score, then consensus reached later. \n",
    "- Use cases: Invalid info, valid but incorrect info: https://docs.xyo.network/XYO-White-Paper.pdf (Sections 4.2 and 4.3)\n",
    "- Do I want a constant chain, or a chain that gets queried and then develops? An API? How will users interact? (Maybe a question for later)\n",
    "- XYO - do I need a signature? What if the node is compromised? I guess maybe it tells me it is? \n",
    "- p2p sims: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-jesus-gfds/00/ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9996836\n",
